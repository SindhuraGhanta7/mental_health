      <h2 id="about">What this page is about</h2>
      <p>
        This portfolio page tells a story with data. It asks simple questions—when do people seek help, who’s represented in this survey,
        how do everyday habits show up in mood—and answers them with clear visuals. The goal is to help a non-technical reader see patterns
        at a glance and understand why those patterns matter in real life.
      </p>
      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Key questions:</strong> Are help-seeking rates steady or seasonal? Who dominates the sample by geography? Do more indoor days
        coincide with higher mood swings? Which indicators tend to move together (association, not causation)?
      </div>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="dataset">
      <h2 id="dataset">About the dataset</h2>
      <p>
        The analysis uses a mental-health check-in dataset with roughly <strong>292,000 responses</strong> and <strong>17 columns</strong> including
        demographics (e.g., Country, Gender, Occupation), context (e.g., self_employed, family_history), self-report signals
        (e.g., Days_Indoors, Mood_Swings, Coping_Struggles), and care-related fields (e.g., treatment, care_options, mental_health_interview).
        Entries were lightly standardized for consistency (e.g., dates parsed; “yes/no/maybe” harmonized; ordered categories for mood and
        indoor days). The dataset reflects <em>self-reported experiences</em> rather than clinical diagnoses.
      </p>
      <p class="callout">
        <strong>Why this matters:</strong> Clean, consistent inputs produce clearer charts—which makes the story easier to trust.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="viz1">
      <h2 id="viz1">Help-seeking over time</h2>
      <p>
        First, we look at whether people report being in treatment month by month. A simple line makes time-based movement obvious:
        rises, dips, and momentum you’d miss in a table. Because months can have different numbers of responses, it’s normal to see a bit
        of “spikiness,” especially where the sample is smaller. The larger pattern still tells us whether help-seeking is steady or seasonal.
      </p>

             alt="Line chart showing the monthly proportion of respondents reporting they are in treatment." />
        <figcaption>
          Figure 1. Monthly share of respondents in treatment. Variability suggests help-seeking is a living metric, not a fixed constant.
        </figcaption>
        <p class="why"><strong>Why this visualization helps:</strong> Time series lines are the most direct way to reveal trends and seasonality.
        They turn a long list of dates into a shape our eyes can track instantly.</p>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <strong>What it means:</strong> Organizations should monitor help-seeking continuously, not as a once-a-year snapshot. If the month-to-month
        signal looks noisy, a three-month rolling average can stabilize the line without hiding meaningful change.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="viz2">
      <h2 id="viz2">Who’s in the sample</h2>
      <p>
        Before drawing broad conclusions, we need to understand who responded. A horizontal bar chart of the top countries
        shows sample concentration quickly. In many public surveys, a handful of countries contribute the majority of entries—useful context
        when thinking about generalization.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/mental_health/viz2_top15_countries.png"
             alt="Horizontal bars for the top 15 countries by respondent count, longest bars indicate the most represented countries." />
        <figcaption>
          Figure 2. Top 15 countries by respondent count. The sample is concentrated rather than evenly global.
        </figcaption>
        <p class="why"><strong>Why this visualization helps:</strong> Ranked bars make magnitude comparisons effortless and immediately communicate
        which groups dominate a sample.</p>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <strong>What it means:</strong> Prefer within-country comparisons or apply simple weighting if you want a balanced global read.
        This keeps heavy contributors from drowning out smaller regions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="viz3">
      <h2 id="viz3">Do everyday habits show up in mood?</h2>
      <p>
        Here we compare mood levels across groups of “days spent indoors.” A 100% stacked bar keeps things fair:
        each group’s bar sums to 100%, so we’re comparing proportions rather than raw counts (which could be very different).
        The pattern is intuitive—groups reporting more indoor days tend to show a higher share of “High” mood swings.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/mental_health/viz3_mood_by_daysindoors_stacked.png"
             alt="100% stacked bars showing proportions of Low, Medium, and High mood swings across groups of days spent indoors." />
        <figcaption>
          Figure 3. Mood-swing composition across indoor-time groups. The share of “High” generally rises with more indoor days.
        </figcaption>
        <p class="why"><strong>Why this visualization helps:</strong> 100% stacked bars make group compositions directly comparable—even when the groups
        contain different numbers of people.</p>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <strong>What it means:</strong> Correlation isn’t causation, but the signal suggests practical nudges: daylight exposure, short outdoor breaks,
        and movement can be simple, low-cost supports for mood.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="viz4">
      <h2 id="viz4">What tends to move together</h2>
      <p>
        Finally, we show a correlation heatmap across key indicators—family history, treatment, care familiarity, interview comfort,
        mood level, and time indoors. This matrix condenses many relationships into one view, highlighting places where variables
        travel together. For example, being comfortable with care options and interview settings tends to align with being in treatment.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/mental_health/viz4_correlation_heatmap.png"
             alt="Color-coded correlation matrix with numeric annotations showing where variables have stronger or weaker associations." />
        <figcaption>
          Figure 4. Correlations among indicators (Pearson r). Darker color and larger absolute values indicate stronger associations.
        </figcaption>
        <p class="why"><strong>Why this visualization helps:</strong> A heatmap compresses dozens of pairwise comparisons into a single picture,
        letting readers spot clusters and priorities without wading through a long table.</p>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <strong>What it means:</strong> Awareness and navigation often accompany care. If the goal is to close the gap between noticing a problem and
        getting help, improving clarity about options and reducing interview anxiety are good places to start.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="insights">
      <h2 id="insights">What we should take away</h2>
      <p>
        Help-seeking changes over time; it’s worth tracking monthly and aligning outreach with the calendar. The sample’s geography matters,
        so be careful when generalizing and consider within-country views. Everyday environments show up in mood, so small, repeatable
        habits can make a difference. And when people understand care options and feel comfortable with the process, they’re more likely
        to be in treatment—an actionable reminder to reduce friction at the moment help is needed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="limits">
      <h2 id="limits">Limitations & next steps</h2>
      <p>
        This is self-reported survey data, so it reflects perception more than diagnosis, and participation isn’t perfectly representative across
        countries. Correlations describe association, not cause. To build on this work, we’d smooth the time series, produce country-specific
        dashboards, explore subgroups (students, self-employed), and fit a simple model to estimate how much each factor moves the odds of being
        in treatment—always with proper caveats.
